Disable Scalos help
-------------------

Amiga OS 3.1.4 doesn't work well with ClassicWB's
installed Scalos and will result in NewIcons to appear
garbled or distorted. The only current solution is
disabling Scalos to properly show NewIcons.

If Scalos is not disabled during ClassicWB
installation, it can always be enabled or disabled
later using "Run", "Settings" and "Scalos".

To get similar functionality as Scalos provides, Tools
Daemon and Magic Menu had been added. These can be
enabled or disabled later using "Run", "Settings",
"Components", "ToolsDaemon" and "MagicMenu".
