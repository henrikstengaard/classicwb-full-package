Scalos Disabled help
--------------------

Scalos is disabled when installing ClassicWB with
Amiga OS 3.2 or 3.1.4. If Scalos is enabled it will
display garbled or distorted NewIcons in Workbench.

After installation Scalos can always be enabled or
disabled later using "Run", "Settings" and "Scalos".

To get similar functionality as Scalos provides, Tools
Daemon and Magic Menu had been added. These can be
enabled or disabled later using "Run", "Settings",
"Components", "ToolsDaemon" and "MagicMenu".
